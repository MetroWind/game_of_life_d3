# Conway’s Game of Life in D3

## Why?

I was looking into [D3.js](https://d3js.org), trying to see if it’s
any way I can integrate it into my workflow.  Sadly I decided that
it’s not suitable.  This program is a side-effect of me learning D3.

## Usage

Click to construct the initial state, and press start.  Enjoy the
subtle (maybe not) visual effects~~

## Some remarks

The last time (and 1st time) I wrote a Game of Life program was about
10 years ago, in C++.

It couldn’t run in realtime on my laptop.  Of course at that time I
sucked at programming, but still.
